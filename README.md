# 🧠 Artificial Intelligence Techniques – Practical Programs

This repository contains Python implementations of core **Artificial Intelligence algorithms** and related search or optimization techniques.  
Each file demonstrates a different concept in AI — from classical graph search to modern heuristic optimization — written in simple, modular, and easy-to-understand Python code.

## 📚 Overview

| File Name | Algorithm / Technique | Description |
|------------|------------------------|--------------|
| `Task1a.py` | **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** | Explores nodes level by level using a queue (FIFO). |
| `Task1b.py` | **Depth-First Search (DFS)** | Traverses deep into the graph recursively before backtracking. |
| `Task2.py` | **Hill Climbing (TSP)** | Solves a simplified Travelling Salesman Problem using heuristic hill climbing. |
| `Task3.py` | **A* Search (if included)** | Finds the optimal path using cost + heuristic estimation. |
| `Task4.py` | **Best-First Search / Greedy Search** | Chooses paths based on heuristic proximity to goal. |
| `Task5.py` | **Simulated Annealing** | Optimizes a cost function with probabilistic acceptance of worse states. |
| `Task6.py` | **Genetic Algorithm** | Evolves candidate solutions using selection, crossover, and mutation. |
| `Task7.py` | **Minimax Algorithm** | Used for decision making in two-player games like Tic-Tac-Toe or Chess. |
| `Task8.py` | **Alpha-Beta Pruning** | Optimization of Minimax to reduce explored branches. |
| `Task9.py` | **Constraint Satisfaction** | Solves problems like N-Queens or Sudoku using backtracking with constraints. |
| `Task10.py` | **Knowledge Representation / Expert System** | Demonstrates rule-based inference or logical reasoning. |
